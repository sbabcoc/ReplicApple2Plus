## Saturn 128K RAM card

Researched down to a primary-source technical spec and ready to
implement. (Its companion, the VideoTerm 80-column card, is done -- see
TASK_RETRO.md.)

### Saturn Systems 128K RAM card -- fully spec'd, ready to implement

Primary source: the actual 1982 Saturn Systems Operations Manual
(Chapter 9, "Technical Information"), fetched directly --
https://garrettsworkshop.com/files/RAM128/SATURN128MAN.pdf (also
mirrored at applelogic.org and apple2.org.za). Not a secondhand forum
recollection.

A bank-switched RAM expansion: 8 banks of 16K each (128K total; the 64K
variant is 4 banks), extending the same mechanism as Apple's own
Language Card -- the first 16K bank behaves identically to a Language
Card, so existing Language-Card-aware software works unmodified.

**Addressing**: control range `$C0N0`-`$C0NF`, where N = 8 + slot#
(`$C080`-`$C08F` for slot 0). Address line A2 selects between two
modes: state-select (A2=0: read source, write-enable, which 4K
sub-bank) vs. bank-select (A2=1: which of the 8 16K banks). Full
verbatim truth table:

```
$C0N0: 4K Bank A; RAM read;  write protect
$C0N1: 4K Bank A; ROM read;  write enabled
$C0N2: 4K Bank A; ROM read;  write protect  (power-up default)
$C0N3: 4K Bank A; RAM read;  write enabled
$C0N8: 4K Bank B; RAM read;  write protect
$C0N9: 4K Bank B; ROM read;  write enabled
$C0NA: 4K Bank B; ROM read;  write protect
$C0NB: 4K Bank B; RAM read;  write enabled
$C0N4-$C0N7: select 16K banks 1-4
$C0NC-$C0NF: select 16K banks 5-8
```

**Memory layout**: each 16K bank occupies $D000-$FFFF like the
Language Card, but is internally split: two 4K sub-banks (A and B)
cover $D000-$DFFF (only one visible at a time), and a shared 8K region
covers $E000-$FFFF (common to both sub-banks of that 16K bank).

**Confirmed behavioral divergence from this project's existing
`LanguageCard`**: on real Saturn hardware, *either a read or a write*
to a write-enable-eligible address counts toward the double-access
arming sequence -- not reads-only, the way the standard Language Card
(and this project's existing `LanguageCard.java`) works. Manual's own
wording: "accomplished by either reading or writing." This is a real
difference to implement deliberately, not something to silently reuse
from the existing class.

**LED indicator behavior** (A3/A1/A0 + RAM-READ, useful for any future
front-panel/status display) and the full "16 possible states" table are
in the manual; not reproduced here since they're not needed to pass
`PDL()`-style software compatibility, only documented for completeness
if ever wanted.

Given `LanguageCard` already exists and is correct, the Saturn card is
a generalization of it to 8 banks plus the double-access divergence --
not a from-scratch peripheral.

## Known issues and leads

Problems observed, limitations accepted, and leads noticed in passing.
Unless an entry says it was observed, treat it as a lead to confirm
with a real failing case before changing code.

- **Blank WOZ images leave INFO "optimal bit timing" at 0.**
  `WozDiskImage.buildBlankFileBytes` doesn't set INFO byte 39; the WOZ
  spec gives 32 (4 µs) for 5.25" disks. Not known to cause a problem.
- **VideoTerm features not modeled.** The alternate character set (VRAM
  bit 7 set; drawn with the standard glyphs instead) and the CRTC's light
  pen registers (R16/R17 read 0). Nothing known uses either.
